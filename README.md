# Simple-SysAdmin-Scripts
Real-world script examples to help others with similar problems.

This is my attempt to give back to a scripting/IT community that has given so much to me over the years.

My focus is to provide tools/scripts that I've used in real production environments and have saved me lots of manual work. Unlike many of the training courses I've taken, I will try to always use Best Practices for a production environment. Since I'm not a Powershell instructor, I'm not looking to simplify any process for the sake of easier understanding, if it means compromising the environment or lessening security.

I'm always excited to learn more and ready for useful feedback. I have a pretty tough hide, but still please try to be nice.

Note: I will always try to give credit to those I've borrowed from, and give full credit when I change very little of the author's original code.
* Most of this is taken from wonderful Pluralsight courses, MS Learn (previously Virtual Academy) and training books.

  * I am greatly indebted to: Jeffrey Snover, Don Jones, Jeff Hicks, Jason Helmick, Ashley McGlone, Adam Bertram, Michael Bender and so many others. 

Much respect to all the underloved and underappreciated IT Professionals out there working in the trenches!
