# Some quick notes and defintions on Agile, Scrum, Waterfall and Kanban Project Managment in relation to DevOps

## Agile Project Management is a project philosophy or framework that takes an iterative approach towards the completion of a project. 

The goal of the Agile approach is to create early, measurable ROI through defined, iterative delivery of product features. 

Due to the iterative nature of Agile approaches, continuous involvement with the client is necessary to ensure that the expectations are aligned and to allow the project manager to adapt to changes throughout the process. 

## **Scrum Project Management** is one of the most popular Agile methodologies used by project managers.

“Whereas Agile is a philosophy or orientation, Scrum is a specific methodology for how one manages a project,” Griffin says. “It provides a process for how to identify the work, who will do the work, how it will be done, and when it will be completed by.” 

In Scrum project management, the project team, led by the project manager, consists of a product owner, Scrum master, and other cross-functional team members. The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product, while the Scrum master is accountable for ensuring that the project team follows the Scrum methodology.

The Scrum methodology is characterized by short phases or “sprints” when project work occurs. During sprint planning, the project team identifies a small part of the scope to be completed during the upcoming sprint, which is usually a two to four week period of time. 

**The key difference between Agile and Scrum** is that while Agile is a project management philosophy that utilizes a core set of values or principles, Scrum is a specific Agile methodology that is used to facilitate a project.

While Agile and Scrum often get most of the attention, there are other methodologies you should be aware of.

## Waterfall Project Management is another popular strategy that takes a different approach to project management than Agile. 
While Agile is an iterative and adaptive approach to project management, Waterfall is linear in nature and doesn’t allow for revisiting previous steps and phases.

Waterfall works well for small projects with clear end goals, while Agile is best for large projects that require more flexibility. Another key difference between these two approaches is the level of stakeholder involvement. In Waterfall, clients aren’t typically involved, whereas in Agile, client feedback is crucial. 

## Kanban Project Management is a type of Agile methodology that seeks to improve the project management process through workflow visualization using a tool called a Kanban board.

A Kanban board is composed of columns that depict a specific stage in the project management process, with cards or sticky notes representing tasks placed in the appropriate stage. As the project progresses, the cards will move from column to column on the board until they are completed.

A key difference between Kanban and other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, is that there are typically limitations regarding how many tasks can be in progress at one time. Project management teams will typically assign a specific number of tasks to each column on the board, which means that new tasks cannot begin until others have been completed.

* For example, Github Projects uses Kanban boards
