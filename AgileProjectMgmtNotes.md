Some quick notes and defintions on Agile, Scrum, Waterfall and Kanban Project Managment in relation to DevOps

Put simply, Agile project management is a project philosophy or framework that takes an iterative approach towards the completion of a project. 

The Project Management Institute (PMI) says the goal of the Agile approach is to create early, measurable ROI through defined, iterative delivery of product features. 

Due to the iterative nature of Agile approaches, continuous involvement with the client is necessary to ensure that the expectations are aligned and to allow the project manager to adapt to changes throughout the process.
